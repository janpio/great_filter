Great Filter stores your filtering preferences locally on your device using Chrome's secure storage system. This data never leaves your browser and is only used to maintain your personalized filtering configuration across sessions.

When filtering content, the extension sends post content from social media sites along with your configured topics to AI services for analysis. This content is processed anonymously in real-time to determine filtering decisions.

If you provide your own OpenRouter API key, requests go directly from your browser to OpenRouter's API (see OpenRouter's [Privacy Policy](https://openrouter.ai/privacy)).

If you use the free tier, requests are routed through a proxy server (hosted on Vercel) that enforces rate limiting. The proxy does not log, store, or retain any content data. It forwards requests to OpenRouter's API and returns responses.

The extension does not collect, store, or share any personal information, browsing history, user identifiers.
